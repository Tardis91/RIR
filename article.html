    <h1>What’s Driving UK 10-Year Bond Yields?</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>UK 10-year government bond yields play a critical role in the economy: they influence mortgage rates, corporate borrowing costs, and serve as a benchmark for long-term financing. Understanding what drives these yields helps investors, policymakers, and businesses anticipate funding costs and monetary policy shifts. In this analysis, we investigate two key domestic factors—currency moves (GBP/USD) and inflation (UK CPI year-on-year)—to quantify their contributions to daily yield movements from 2006 through mid-2025.</p>

    <h2>Data &amp; Methodology</h2>
    <p><strong>Data Sources</strong><br>
    - <strong>UK 10Y Yield</strong>: Daily series from Alpha Vantage’s TREASURY_YIELD endpoint.<br>
    - <strong>GBP/USD FX Rate</strong>: Daily closing FX rates from Alpha Vantage.<br>
    - <strong>UK CPI YoY Inflation</strong>: Year-on-year % change computed from monthly CPI index (series GBRCPIALLMINMEI) pulled from FRED and forward-filled to daily.</p>
    <p><strong>Sample Period:</strong> April 12, 2006 to June 10, 2025.<br>
    <strong>Frequency:</strong> Daily.<br>
    <strong>Estimation:</strong> OLS regression:</p>
    <pre>UK_10Y_Yieldₜ = α + β₁·GBPUSDₜ + β₂·UK_CPI_YoYₜ + εₜ</pre>

    <h2>Regression Results (Table 2)</h2>
    <pre>
Dependent Variable: UK_10Y_Yield  
R² = 0.394  
Observations = 4,724  

               Coef.    Std. Err.     t     P>|t|  
const         -1.682      0.090   –18.72   0.000  
GBPUSD         2.503      0.056    45.05   0.000  
UK_CPI_YOY     0.279      0.007    42.07   0.000  
    </pre>

    <h2>Economic Interpretation</h2>
    <p><strong>Currency Dynamics:</strong> A stronger pound often coincides with tighter monetary conditions or capital inflows, pushing yields higher. FX markets price in divergences between UK and US policy, so GBP appreciation forecasts higher UK rates.</p>
    <p><strong>Inflation Expectations:</strong> Higher CPI YoY signals rising consumer prices, eroding real returns and prompting market expectations of Bank of England rate hikes, embedding them into longer-term yields.</p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Omitted variables: global rates (e.g. UST10Y), BoE base rate, and risk sentiment measures.</li>
        <li>Daily frequency noise may overstate FX’s role relative to fundamentals.</li>
        <li>Residual autocorrelation suggests potential for ARIMA/GARCH modeling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Empirically, currency movements have been the dominant short-term driver of UK 10-year yields, with inflation also significant but smaller. For investors and policymakers, monitoring GBP/USD dynamics alongside inflation expectations is crucial for yield forecasting. Future work could include global rate spreads and advanced time-series methods to capture persistence and spillovers.</p>
