    <h1>What’s Driving UK 10-Year Bond Yields?</h1>
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Government bond yields—especially the 10-year tenor—serve as a cornerstone for financial markets and economic policymaking. In the UK, the 10-year gilt yield underpins mortgage rates, corporate borrowing costs, pension valuations, and even the yields on shorter‐term securities. When yields move, they ripple through every corner of the economy, influencing decisions from household mortgages to multinational investment strategies.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, UK bond yields have traversed dramatic highs and lows: they hovered near 5 percent in the mid-2000s, plunged to historic lows during the 2008 financial crisis and again in the COVID-19 downturn, and then surged above 4 percent by mid-2025. What explains these swings? Beyond headline drivers like central bank policy and global market risk sentiment, two domestic factors stand out:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Currency Movements:</strong> Fluctuations in the pound versus the dollar signal shifts in cross-border capital flows, interest rate expectations, and relative monetary tightening between the UK and the US.</li>
  <li><strong>Inflation Dynamics:</strong> Rising consumer prices erode the real return on fixed-income securities unless nominal yields adjust upward—while also shaping market expectations of Bank of England rate moves.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this analysis, we bring together daily data on UK 10-year gilt yields, the GBP/USD exchange rate, and UK year-on-year inflation (CPI) from 2006 through June 2025. By combining clear visualizations, correlation analysis, and a concise regression framework, we quantify exactly how much of gilt yield variation can be attributed to currency swings versus inflation pressures—and draw out the economic narrative driving those results.</p>

    <h2>Data &amp; Methodology</h2>
    <p><strong>Data Sources</strong><br>
    - <strong>UK 10Y Yield</strong>: Daily series from Alpha Vantage’s TREASURY_YIELD endpoint.<br>
    - <strong>GBP/USD FX Rate</strong>: Daily closing FX rates from Alpha Vantage.<br>
    - <strong>UK CPI YoY Inflation</strong>: Year-on-year % change computed from monthly CPI index (series GBRCPIALLMINMEI) pulled from FRED and forward-filled to daily.</p>
    <p><strong>Sample Period:</strong> April 12, 2006 to June 10, 2025.<br>
    <strong>Frequency:</strong> Daily.<br>
    <strong>Estimation:</strong> OLS regression:</p>
    <pre>UK_10Y_Yieldₜ = α + β₁·GBPUSDₜ + β₂·UK_CPI_YoYₜ + εₜ</pre>

   <h2>Regression Results</h2>
<p>To quantify the relative impact of currency movements and inflation on UK 10-year gilt yields, we estimated the following daily OLS model over 4,724 observations (Apr 2006–Jun 2025):</p>
<pre>UK_10Y_Yieldₜ = α + β₁·GBPUSDₜ + β₂·UK_CPI_YoYₜ + εₜ</pre>
<table>

<p><strong>Key metrics:</strong>  
<ul>
  <li><strong>R² = 0.394</strong>: The model explains ~39 % of the day-to-day variation in 10-year yields.</li>
  <li>Both predictors are highly significant (p &lt; 0.001), indicating robust relationships in-sample.</li>
  <li>The constant term is negative (−1.682), reflecting baseline yield dynamics when both GBPUSD and inflation are at zero—a statistical artifact given non-zero means.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Economic Interpretation</h2>
<p><strong>1. Currency Movements (GBP/USD)</strong><br>
The positive coefficient of <strong>2.503</strong> means that when the pound strengthens by $0.10 against the dollar, the 10-year yield tends to rise by roughly 0.25 percentage points. This highlights how FX markets—and the flow of international capital they signal—drive gilt yields. A stronger pound often coincides with expectations of tighter UK monetary conditions relative to the US, leading investors to demand higher yield premia on long-term debt.</p>

<p><strong>2. Inflation Expectations (UK CPI YoY)</strong><br>
The inflation coefficient of <strong>0.279</strong> implies that a 1 pp increase in year-on-year CPI inflation is associated with a ~0.28 pp rise in the gilt yield. This is consistent with the view that bond investors require higher nominal yields to offset the erosion of real returns when consumer prices accelerate. It also embeds expectations that the Bank of England will raise policy rates to rein in inflation, especially when CPI surpasses target ranges.</p>

<p><strong>3. Relative Magnitudes</strong><br>
Although both factors are significant, currency moves exert a larger short-term effect on yields because daily FX fluctuations (often 0.5–1 %) translate into more pronounced yield shifts than the typically smaller daily changes in monthly-smoothed inflation (0.01–0.05 pp). This suggests that, on a day-to-day basis, investors react more strongly to global risk and rate-differential signals than to incremental changes in consumer prices.</p>

<p><strong>4. Unexplained Variation</strong><br>
With ~61 % of yield variation left unexplained, other drivers—such as global 10-year UST yields, Bank of England base rate changes, liquidity conditions, and risk sentiment—play important roles. Incorporating those variables, or using higher-frequency monetary policy announcements and volatility indices, could further improve explanatory power.</p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Omitted variables: global rates (e.g. UST10Y), BoE base rate, and risk sentiment measures.</li>
        <li>Daily frequency noise may overstate FX’s role relative to fundamentals.</li>
        <li>Residual autocorrelation suggests potential for ARIMA/GARCH modeling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Empirically, currency movements have been the dominant short-term driver of UK 10-year yields, with inflation also significant but smaller. For investors and policymakers, monitoring GBP/USD dynamics alongside inflation expectations is crucial for yield forecasting. Future work could include global rate spreads and advanced time-series methods to capture persistence and spillovers.</p>
